# Exercise 3

Each house connected to the electric network has a meter. The meter computes and stores how much electrical energy (kW hour) is used by the house. 

The meter sends regularly (say every 24 hours) the consumption over the electric wires (the electric wires of the power network can in fact be used as data transmission lines). 

A remote central server receives the data, stores it and computes a bill (say every two months), sends the bill to the customer. 

The bill can be sent in two different ways:
 
* electronically (email or web site accessible to the customer via username and password),
* on paper.

In the following analyze and model the application that collects power usage from each meter, computes the bill and sends it to the customer. 

1. Define the context diagram (including relevant interfaces)
2. List the requirements in tabular form
3. Write a glossary by defining the key concepts and entities and their relationships, with UML class diagram, for the application 
4. Define the system design diagram
